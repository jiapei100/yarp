YARP 2.3.68 (UNRELEASED) Release Notes
======================================


A (partial) list of bug fixed and issues resolved in this release can be found
[here](https://github.com/robotology/yarp/issues?q=label%3A%22Fixed+in%3A+YARP+2.3.68%22).


Important Changes
-----------------

### Dependencies

* Readline library is no longer used and was replaced with the NetBSD Editline
  library (libedit-dev on debian/ubuntu).

### YARP_OS

* The yarp::os::Contact class was widely refactored:
  * The add*() methods are now deprecated. The new set*() methods should be used
    instead.
  * The by*(), invalid() and empty() factory methods are now deprecated. The
    class constructors should be used instead (a few new constructors were added
    to allow this).
  * The byConfig() method is now deprecated. fromConfig() should be used
    instead.
  * The Contact::toURI() method now accepts an includeCarrier parameter (true by
    default) to simplify the generation of the URI without the carrier.
    Moreover the string returned always end with a `/` character.
  * ROS integration was heavily improved and it is now possible to register
    one `Publisher` and one `Subscriber` on the same `Node` using the same
    topic, and to use tools like `roswtf` and `rqt`.
    If you are using YARP with ROS, upgrading is strongly recommended.
  * Added `ConnectionReader::setParentConnectionReader` method. This method
    should be used by `Carriers` that reimplement `modifyIncomingData` and that
    return a ConnectionReader that is not the same as the one in input.

### YARP_sig
* Important: we removed methods for interoperability with the GNU Scientific Library (GSL). 
  The reason for this was to avoid licensing problems generated by the inclusion of a structure defined by 
  GSL. Methods for interoperability have been implemented in a new library libYARP_gsl (see below). In details: 
  * We removed yarp::sig::Matrix::getGslMatrix()
  * We removed yarp::sig::Vector::getGslVector()
 
### YARP_gsl
* This library contains methods for interoperability with the GNU Scientific Library. Notice that 
  this library is released as GPL (and not LGPL) because it uses a structure defined by GSL.
  * Checkout yarp::gsl::GslMatrix and yarp::gsl::GslVector
 
### YARP_math
* libYARP_math now uses libYARP_gsl internally. A small performance hit could affect methods that use GSL.
    
### CMake Modules

* All deprecated CMake modules have been removed.
* All GTK2 CMake modules have been removed and are no longer installed in
  `${YARP_MODULE_PATH}`. They can still be found in
  [YCM](http://robotology.github.io/ycm).
* The `FindReadline` module has been removed.
* The `YarpPlugin` module and the relative templates received several
  improvements and fixes:
  - `yarp_prepare_plugin` no longer include any directory or namespace.
    As a consecuence, it might be necessary to fix the `TYPE` for plugins adding
    the full namespace to the class name, and to add the current directory to
    CMake include directories.
  - `yarp_prepare_carrier` and `yarp_prepare_device` are deprecated in favour
    of `yarp_prepare_plugin`.
  - The new `TEMPLATE` and `TEMPLATE_DIR` accepted by `yarp_prepare_plugin`
    can be used to specify a file name and a directory for the template that
    will be configured and added to the plugin. If a template is not specified,
    a file `yarp_plugin_<CATEGORY>.cpp.in` is searched in current directory, in
    CMake module path, and in YARP cmake modules directory. If still it cannot
    be found, but the `PARENT_TYPE` argument, containing the name of the parent
    class for the plugin, was specified, then a default template is generated in
    current binary directory. This should simplify the creation of new types of
    plugins. Please note that static plugins will not work with the default
    template.
  - The `CODE` and `WRAPPER` arguments for the `yarp_prepare_plugin` command are
    deprecated, the new `EXTRA_CONFIG` argument should be used instead.
    Each variable in the form `KEY=VALUE` passed to the `EXTRA_CONFIG` argument
    is changed to `YARPPLUG_<KEY>` and used when the template is configured.
    For example `EXTRA_CONFIG WRAPPER=foo` generates the `YARPPLUG_WRAPPER`
    variable that is then replaced in the `yarp_plugin_device.cpp.in`.
  - The `DEFAULT` argument for the `yarp_prepare_plugin` can be used to specify
    whether the plugin should be enabled by default or not (default = OFF).
  - The `ADVANCED` option for the `yarp_prepare_plugin` can be used to specify
    that the generated CMake variable should be marked as advanced
    (default = OFF).
  - The `INTERNAL` option for the `yarp_prepare_plugin` can be used to specify
    that the generated CMake variable should be marked as internal (and
    therefore not displayed in CMake gui). This also implies `DEFAULT=ON` unless
    explicitly specified.
  - The `DOC` argument for the `yarp_prepare_plugin` can be used to specify a
    documentation line for the generated CMake variable.
  - The `OPTION` argument for the `yarp_prepare_plugin` can be used to rename
    the generated CMake option.
  - The `DEPENDS` argument for the `yarp_prepare_plugin` can be used to specify
    a list of dependencies that should be satisfied in order to enable the
    plugin. If these dependencies are not available, the plugin is disabled, and
    the generated CMake option is not shown on CMake.
* All CMake modules from YCM, CMake, and private are now deprecated, and are
  installed only if `YARP_NO_DEPRECATED` is `OFF`. Projects that require these
  files should depend on YCM instead.

### Tools

* `yarpserver2` and `yarpserver3` have been deprecated for a long time, and
  replaced by `yarpserver`, therefore they have been removed. Please update your
  scripts

### GUIs

* All GTK2 GUIs have a Qt5 replacement and have been deprecated since YARP
  2.3.65, therefore they have been removed.


Bug Fixes
---------

### YARP_OS

* Fixed some cases of connections leaving a streaming connection pending.
* Support dynamic plugins when YARP is built without ACE.
* Fixed several possible race conditions in `yarp::os::Thread`.
* `getBusInfo` ROS command was implemented.
* `getMasterUri` ROS command was implemented.
* `getPid` ROS command was fixed and now returns just one integer instead of a
  vector.
* The right caller_id is returned by `PortCore` for `publisherUpdate` and
  `requestTopic` ROS commands.
* The right caller_id is returned by the tcpros carrier.
* `yarp::os::Node` now handles correctly multiple publishers and subscribers on
  the same topic. The limit on YARP is that only one publisher and one
  subscriber can be registered on the same node using the same topic.
* The `Carriers` class was moved outside of the impl namespace (#402).

### Carriers

* Fixed portmonitor and bayer carriers not handling envelope correctly when
  attached on the receiving side (#729, #782, #909).

### GUIs

* Fixed yarpmanager cannot display and disconnect mjpeg connections (#595).



New Features
------------

### YARP_OS

* Improved PortCore `list [in|out]` commands
  They also return now:
  * `(connectionless 1)` when the connection is connectionless (i.e. udp).
  * `(push 0)` when the connection is not push (i.e. mjpeg).
* Improved compiler detection and added <yarp/conf/compiler.h> header
  containing macros to check if a specific feature is available.
* Added method `yarp::os::Thread::yield()` that reschedules the execution of
  current thread, allowing other threads to run.
* Added method `yarp::os::Contactable::resetReporter()` to remove the
  `PortReport` set by `setReporter()`.

### YARP_math

* Added the `yarp::math::FrameTransform` class.

### YARP_dev

* Added the `yarp::dev::IDepthSensor` and `yarp::dev::IRGBDSensor` interfaces.
* Added the `yarp::dev::IFrameTransform.h interface.
* Added the `transformServer` and `transformClient` devices.

### Carriers

* Added `depthimage` portmonitor plugin.

### Modules

* The `ControlBoardRemapper` and `RemoteControlBoardRemapper` devices were
  introduced that is a state-less and thread-less YARP device that takes axes
  belonging to several controlboards and expose them as a unique controlboard
  device.
* The `RGBDSensorClient` and `RGBDSensorWrapper` devices were added.
* Rangefinder2DWrapper: use timetamp from device driver.

### GUIs

* yarpmanager use service tag from module description to add as input/output
  service port
